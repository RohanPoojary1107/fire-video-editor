# Practices to Continue

- Consistent meetings with all group members and delivering continuous feedback.

# New Practices to Follow

- Pair up with a team member to code review your merges for the rest of the project.

# Harmful Practices to Discard

- Working on tasks longer than necessary.
- Not splitting up features with enough subtasks.
- Cramming work during the end of the sprint.

# Sprint Experience

- Sprint2 went much smoother than Sprint1.
