<h1>SUMMARY.MD</h1> <br>
The main motive of our project is to introduce the internet world to an efficient video editing application. We want to engineer a web based video editor that allows users to manipulate videos from their computer, export the final video and save the project files to a cloud account. We are designing this project to be very easy to use for the average user.<br>

<b>Key User Case 1</b> - David: A middle school student who likes to play games and upload his game play on Youtube. He’s not a professional video editor. He wants to become the popular dude in his school through the means of his videos. He plays fortnite daily and uploads his highlights to youtube. After coming back from school he plays fortnite for around 5 hours and then does any homework from school.
<br><br>
<b>Key User Case 2</b> - Jennifer: An elementary school math teacher who makes short lecture videos about simple math concepts and uploads her videos as a substitute for lectures for her students. She isn’t someone who has a high tech aptitude and is looking for an easy to use product to edit her lecture videos.
<br><br>
<b>Key Scenario 1</b>: David is in search of an easy to use video editor to edit his most recent fortnite gameplay. He wants to crop the video part where he didn’t play as good as he wanted. He also wants to speed up some boring part of his gameplay like navigating through the terrain. 
<br><br>
<b>Key Scenario 2</b>: Jennifer wants a simple interface. Jennifer wants to add some short animations in her lectures to explain some tricky concepts easily. She records her video in one go and separates the video into short topics. She wants to segment from the long video and make short videos that she can download on her computer and upload later.
