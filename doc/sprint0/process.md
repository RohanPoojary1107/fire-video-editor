- How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any? <br>
We created a Discord server to communicate with each other. <br>
- How did you make decisions? <br>
Our decisions were made by reaching a consensus. <br>
- How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate? <br>
Points for the user stories were based on the difficulty, and size of the user story. Priority was defined based on the degradation of usability and user experience. <br>
- How frequently did you meet? <br>
We met 3 times a week for 1 hour each. <br>
- What lessons should you take forward to the next phase? <br>
We should start working on the deliverables earlier and get more organized using JIRA.
